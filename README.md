Face Attendance Anti-Spoofing System
• Developed a real-time face recognition system with integrated anti-spoofing measures for secure attendance
tracking.
• Utilized OpenCV, dlib, and MediaPipe to detect faces, analyze eye blinks, and assess liveness through texture
analysis and gesture detection.
• Implemented smartphone detection using YOLOv4 to ensure user focus during attendance capture.
• Enhanced user authentication by incorporating facial landmarks, blink detection, and texture-based liveness
checks to prevent spoofing.
• Contributed to secure and reliable attendance management, particularly for educational and professional
environments.
